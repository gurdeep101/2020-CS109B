The B82 SBS will be launched in 2018 by NYC DOT and NYCTA. The capital project focuses on the 7.5-mile portion of the entire SBS corridor along Kings Highway (Segment K), Flatlands Avenue (Segment F), and Pennsylvania Avenue (Segment P). Along these three corridors, the capital project will build a combination of new bus lanes with high-quality bus stations and signal timing changes, as well as safety improvements for bus passengers, pedestrians, and all street users. Bus stops will be rehabilitated with expanded ADA-accessible platforms, bus shelters, lighting, and seating. Concrete curb extensions and central medians will be built to reduce crossing distances. Additionally, all the medians along Kings Highway will be reconstructed bringing them to a state of good repair along with the bus stops.",Streets and Roadways,Brooklyn,DOT,,Design,12/07/17,84196154,,2487154,,1999154,05/09/24,0,0,
