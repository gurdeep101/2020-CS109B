    "<div class='exercise'> <b> Question 2: Set-up an AutoEncoder [20 points] </b> </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define custom convolutional layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide below the skeleton of a custom keras layer that you need to complete to build the following models. You should read the Keras [guidelines](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models) on how to build custom layers. You are required to fill the specific methods indicated below on each part.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then construct an autoencoder using both custom layers, and visualize the AE image reconstruction and latent spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1** Setup a custom layer consisting of convolutional layers and complete the `__init__` and `call` methods of the `ConvEncoder` class. We recommend to use 4 convolutional layers and dropout layers alternatively, filters of size 5x5, 'relu' activations, 'same' padding, `[9, 18, 32, 64]` channels respectively on each layer, and strides of 2x2. The intention is to halve the spatial dimensions on each convolutional layer while augmenting the number of channels on deeper layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use this layer repeatedly when building your subsequent models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2** Setup a custom layer consisting of convolutional layers and complete the `__init__` and `call` methods of the `ConvDecoder` class. We will refer to the input dimension of this layer as `latent_dim`. Make sure the output dimension of this layer is equal to the input dimension of your images, i.e., (64,64,3) if you followed our recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using `Conv2DTranspose` layers instead of `Conv2D` similar to `ConvEncoder`. Using `Conv2DTranspose` will have the desired effect in terms of inverting previous operations; for example, setting a stride of 2x2 will double the output size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3** Create a Keras model `AE`. Use the previously defined `ConvEncoder` and `ConvDecoder` layer classes you just completed to build your autoencoder. Between these layers, [flatten](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Flatten) the input and incorporate two intermediate [Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense), and [reshape](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Reshape) layers. More precisely, use the following architecture:\n",
    "- Input image.\n",
    "- ConvEncoder layer.\n",
    "- Flatten layer.\n",
    "- **Dense layer with linear activation** and `bottleneck_dim=128` units (recommended dimension).\n",
    "- **Dense layer with ReLu activation**.\n",
    "- Reshape layer to `latent_dim`.\n",
    "- ConvDecoder layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.4** Why do we suggest the first dense layer after the `ConvEncoder` layer use `linear` activation in the `AE` model? Is it necessary requirement or not? Explain your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.5** Train the `AE` model (use MSE loss criterion and an optimizer of your choice). We found 5 epochs sufficed to train our model (feel free to adjust this value). Print a summary of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We recommend [saving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load) the trained model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.6** Visualize 5 random original and reconstructed images fed to the autoencoder from the validation data.\n",
    "\n",

    "<div class='exercise'> <b> Question 3: Set-up a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder [20 points].</b> </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will code a standard Variational Autoencoder. You will first create a custom layer `Sampling` that takes the mean and log-variance of a Gaussian distribution as inputs, and returns a sample from that distribution. You will use this sample as a latent representation of your probabilistic encoder conditioned on the input image, and use it to reconstruct an image. You will build the complete VAE architecture and study its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to minimize the negative ELBO function formed by a reconstruction loss and a regularization term over the mean and variance of the probabilistic encoder. You will train two VAE models, one with no regularization, and a second with regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.1** Complete the `call` function of Sampling keras layer. This function takes as input the mean and log-variance vectors of a multivariate Gaussian distribution and returns a sampled tensor from this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.2** Create two  Variational AutoEncoder models named `VAE1` and `VAE2`. Use the `ConvEncoder` and `ConvDecoder` layer classes you completed in Question 2 and the `Sampling` layer from 3.1. Both VAEs should have the following architecture:\n",
    "- Input image.\n",
    "- ConvEncoder.\n",
    "- Flatten layer.\n",
    "- Dense layer with linear activation and 128 units to predict the mean of the encoder conditional distribution $q_x(z)=N(\\mu,\\sigma)$.\n",
    "- Dense layer with linear activation and 128 units to predict the log-variance of the encoder conditional distribution $q_x(z)=N(\\mu,\\sigma)$.\n",
    "- Sampling layer you completed in Question 3.1.\n",
    "- Dense layer with ReLu activation.\n",
    "- Reshape layer: reshapes the output of dense into `latent_dim`.\n",
    "- ConvDecoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, `VAE1` should not use any regularization of the probabilistic encoder (from the prior). \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, `VAE2` should incorporate a KL loss to regularize the probabilistic encoder to normal Gaussian of zero mean and unit variance acting as prior, as explained in class. \n",
    "You may use the following expression: `kl_loss = - reg * 0.5 * tf.reduce_mean(z_log_var - tf.square(z_mean) - tf.exp(z_log_var) + 1)`, where a reasonable value for `reg = 0.1` (feel free to adjust).\n",
    "To include the intermediate loss in `VAE2`, you may use the function `add_loss` from keras models/layers as explained in the [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/train_and_evaluate). \n",
    "\n",
    "**We recommend saving your trained models.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.3** Why do we use linear activation values to encode the mean and log-variance of the probabilistic encoder? Explain your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.4** Visualize 1 original image and 5 reconstructed images from the validation data fed to `VAE1` and `VAE2`. Comment on the reconstructed images. Notice that you may need to tune penalty regularization term to observe differences between `VAE1` and `VAE2` (there should be differences!).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.5** Visualize the first 2 principal components (PCs) and the t-SNE decomposition of the validation data on both `VAE1` and `VAE2` obtained from the latent space, i.e., a sample drawn from the probabilistic encoder for a given input. Color the datapoints depending on the input's attributes of your choice (`Male` and `Smiling` if these were your choice). Draw four separate scatterplots in total. Explain what you observe."

    "Conditional VAEs are similar to standard VAEs were you incorporate an input's label/information into the latent space. When the model is trained in this form, the model learns to distinguish between these features. For example, you can select features on latent space manually, and explore the space of representations in an explicit manner. We point you to [one](https://wiseodd.github.io/techblog/2016/12/17/conditional-vae/) and [two](https://ijdykeman.github.io/ml/2016/12/21/cvae.html) short tutorials on conditional VAEs. Additionally, you may be interested in reading the [original paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5775-learning-structured-output-representation-using-deep-conditional-generative-models.pdf), or a [continuation paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7880-learning-latent-subspaces-in-variational-autoencoders.pdf). \n",
