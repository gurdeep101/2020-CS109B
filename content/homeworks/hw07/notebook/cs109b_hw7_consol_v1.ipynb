    "<div class='exercise'> <b> Question 2: Set-up an AutoEncoder [20 points] </b> </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define custom convolutional layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide below the skeleton of a custom keras layer that you need to complete to build the following models. You should read the Keras [guidelines](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models) on how to build custom layers. You are required to fill the specific methods indicated below on each part.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then construct an autoencoder using both custom layers, and visualize the AE image reconstruction and latent spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1** Setup a custom layer consisting of convolutional layers and complete the `__init__` and `call` methods of the `ConvEncoder` class. We recommend to use 4 convolutional layers and dropout layers alternatively, filters of size 5x5, 'relu' activations, 'same' padding, `[9, 18, 32, 64]` channels respectively on each layer, and strides of 2x2. The intention is to halve the spatial dimensions on each convolutional layer while augmenting the number of channels on deeper layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use this layer repeatedly when building your subsequent models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2** Setup a custom layer consisting of convolutional layers and complete the `__init__` and `call` methods of the `ConvDecoder` class. We will refer to the input dimension of this layer as `latent_dim`. Make sure the output dimension of this layer is equal to the input dimension of your images, i.e., (64,64,3) if you followed our recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using `Conv2DTranspose` layers instead of `Conv2D` similar to `ConvEncoder`. Using `Conv2DTranspose` will have the desired effect in terms of inverting previous operations; for example, setting a stride of 2x2 will double the output size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3** Create a Keras model `AE`. Use the previously defined `ConvEncoder` and `ConvDecoder` layer classes you just completed to build your autoencoder. Between these layers, [flatten](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Flatten) the input and incorporate two intermediate [Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense), and [reshape](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Reshape) layers. More precisely, use the following architecture:\n",
    "- Input image.\n",
    "- ConvEncoder layer.\n",
    "- Flatten layer.\n",
    "- **Dense layer with linear activation** and `bottleneck_dim=128` units (recommended dimension).\n",
    "- **Dense layer with ReLu activation**.\n",
    "- Reshape layer to `latent_dim`.\n",
    "- ConvDecoder layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.4** Why do we suggest the first dense layer after the `ConvEncoder` layer use `linear` activation in the `AE` model? Is it necessary requirement or not? Explain your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.5** Train the `AE` model (use MSE loss criterion and an optimizer of your choice). We found 5 epochs sufficed to train our model (feel free to adjust this value). Print a summary of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We recommend [saving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load) the trained model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.6** Visualize 5 random original and reconstructed images fed to the autoencoder from the validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.7** Visualize the first 2 [principal components](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) and [t-SNE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) projection onto the plane of the latent representation of the validation images. Use the representation after the first dense layer where `bottleneck_dim=128` to compute the PCs and t-SNE projections. Retrieve at least `1024` images and color each input by class type, for example, `Male` and `Smiling` (if these where your chosen attributes), for **each scatter plot visualization** and attributes. You need to present 4 scatter plots in total. Explain your results."

You will first create a custom layer `Sampling` that takes the mean and log-variance of a Gaussian distribution as inputs, and returns a sample from that distribution. You will use this sample as a latent representation of your probabilistic encoder conditioned on the input image, and use it to reconstruct an image. You will build the complete VAE architecture and study its properties.\n",

    "**3.4** Visualize 1 original image and 5 reconstructed images from the validation data fed to `VAE1` and `VAE2`. Comment on the reconstructed images.

    "Conditional VAEs are similar to standard VAEs were you incorporate an input's label/information into the latent space. When the model is trained in this form, the model learns to distinguish between these features. For example, you can select features on latent space manually, and explore the space of representations in an explicit manner. We point you to [one](https://wiseodd.github.io/techblog/2016/12/17/conditional-vae/) and [two](https://ijdykeman.github.io/ml/2016/12/21/cvae.html) short tutorials on conditional VAEs. Additionally, you may be interested in reading the [original paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5775-learning-structured-output-representation-using-deep-conditional-generative-models.pdf), or a [continuation paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7880-learning-latent-subspaces-in-variational-autoencoders.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you are going to build a conditional VAE, and reconstruct images by altering their attributes. For example, pick a set of 'not smiling men' and transform them by changing the label conditions such as 'smile' or 'gender' in latent space. You can choose whatever attributes you want, as long as the reconstructed latent space shows reasonable success when changing the attribute labels.\n",
